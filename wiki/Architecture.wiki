= Introduction =

Below diagram shows basic architecture of QuickServer framework. The seven spokes on the QuickServer block are the seven Service interface methods.

QuickServerConfig may also be directly used in initService() to configure QuickServer.

Note: QSAdminServer is not shown in this diagram, it is a composed QuickServer within the main QuickServer.

Of the eight components/class (application specific implementations) connected to QuickServer block only one of the (`#`) class is the absolutely necessary class (see below).

ClientHandler implementation object is used from the pool of objects for every client connected; optional ClientData class is associated with the ClientHandler class. Threads are picked from pool and used to execute any task that ClientHandler needs to perform.

ClientHandler object contain references to 
ClientEventHandler (optional)
ClientCommandHandler (`#`)
ClientObjectHandler (`#`)
ClientBinaryHandler (`#`)
ClientWriteHandler (optional)
ClientAuthenticationHandler (optional) 
ClientExtendedEventHandler (optional)
objects created by QuickServer when it starts.

`[``#``]` = Any one of these has to be set based on default DataMode for input.

QuickServerConfig object is constructed by initService() method of the Service interface, that QuickServer implements, after reading configuration from XML file. 

= QuickServer - Threading Model =

For every server instance there will be

 * Only one instance of QuickServer 
 * Only one instance of GhostSocketReaper (if timeout is > 0)
 * Only one instance of any/all business classes like ClientEventHandler, ClientCommandHandler, ClientObjectHandler, ClientBinaryHandler, ClientWriteHandler, ClientAuthenticationHandler, ClientExtendedEventHandler 
 * Every client connected will have a ClientHandler implementation associated with it based on the server mode
    * Blocking Mode = BlockingClientHandler 
    * Non Blocking Mode = NonBlockingClientHandler 
* If ClientData is set, then every ClientHandler will have an instance of ClientData associated with it. The ClientData objects will be polled if it implements PoolableObject interface.
 * Based on the server mode, threads will be associated with ClientHandler to execute any processing for the client i.e.;
    * In Blocking Mode: A thread is dedicated to every ClientHandler for processing events from the client. 
    * In Non Blocking Mode: A thread is associated with a ClientHandler only as needed or when data is available for processing.
      * When ever any data is available for reading the thread is assigned with READ as ClientEvent.
      * If client registers for any write event, then whenever the data can be written a thread is assigned with WRITE event for processing any writes.

In the same JVM, there can be more than one instance of QuickServer object that is running based on the implementation. A typical QuickServer setup will have one QuickServer object for the main server and another for the QSAdminServer.
